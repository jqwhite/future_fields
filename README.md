# Future Fields

Assessing crops for fields based on weather, water, sun, and soil: now and mid-century.

## Summary

The Future Fields Project assess the suitability of crops for fields in four states of the US Southwest for medium carbon and high carbon climate scenarios. Each field in the [ Crop Sequence Boundary ](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/) 2016-2023 dataset was assessed for each crop in the [FAO EcoCrop database](https://gaez.fao.org/pages/ecocrop).  

For each field and crop species, scores were calculated for:

- growing season
- temperature
- photoperiod
- rainfall
- soil texture
- KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate zone
- USDA Plant Hardiness Zone

Scores were calculated for three scenarios:

- recent past (1970-2005)
- mid-century medium carbon (2039-2065, RCP 4.5)
- mid-century high carbon 


Crop species with the highest overall score are deemed suitable for the field.
